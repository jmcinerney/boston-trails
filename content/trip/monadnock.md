Known as one of the most hiked mountains in the world, Monadnock can be a busy place, but it's not hard to avoid the crowds by getting off on some of its many side trails. For just about an hour and a half from Boston, Monadnock offers up a serious amount of vertical climbing and rocky technical terrain.
