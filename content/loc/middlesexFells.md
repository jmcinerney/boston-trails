Just North of Cambridge and Somerville the Middlesex Fells is a massive parcel of conservation land with an extensive trail network. While the highest point may be just 320 feet above sea level, there is plenty of vertical terrain packed into the Fells and lots of technical rocky running to be had, particularly on the Eastern side.

Located adjacent to the towns of Winchester, Stoneham, Melrose, Malden and Medford.
